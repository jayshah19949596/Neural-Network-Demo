    "Due date: Sept. 17, 2017\n",
    " \n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "---\n",
    " - The purpose of the this assignment is to practice with a single neuron decision boundary and learning rule.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Write a program to display the decision boundary for a single neuron with two inputs.\n",
    " - Your program should:\n",
    "       1] Draw the boundary\n",
    "       2] Display the region of the input space which corresponds to the positive output of neuron in green color.\n",
    "       3] Display the region of the input space which corresponds to the zero or negative output of neuron in red color.\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Your program should also include 3 sliders, 2 buttons, and one drop down selection box.\n",
    " \n",
    "   **Sliders**\n",
    "     - Slider 1: Change w1 (first weight) between -10 and 10. Default value = 1\n",
    "     - Slider 2: Change w2 (second weight) between -10 and 10. Default value = 1\n",
    "     - Slider 3: Change b (bias between -10 and 10. Default value=0\n",
    " \n",
    "   **Buttons**\n",
    "     - Button1: Train. Clicking this button should adjust the weights and bias for 100 steps using the learning rule. \n",
    "                      `Wnew =Wold+ epT  where  e = t â€“ a`\n",
    "     - Button 2: Create random data. Assuming that there are only two possible target values 1 and -1 (two classes), this button should create 4 random data points (two points for each class). \n",
    "     - The range of data points should be from -10 to 10 for both dimensions.\n",
    " \n",
    "   **Drop Down Selection**\n",
    "     - The drop down box should allow the user to select between three transfer functions (Symmetrical Hard limit, Hyperbolic Tangent, and Linear)\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Notes:\n",
    "        - Changing any of the parameters should immediately be reflected in the displayed output.\n",
    "        - Displayed range of input space should be from -10 to 10 for both dimensions.\n",
    "        - Assume that there are only two possible classes. The target value for one class should be 1 and for the other class should be -1.\n",
    "        - The learning rule for this assignment is the same as the Perceptron learning rule which is designed for the hardlimit transfer function. \n",
    "        - Applying the same rule to hyperbolic tangent and linear transfer function does not exactly correspond to the Perceptron learning rule and may create contradictory situations. \n",
    "        - However experimenting with these transfer functions will give you insight into the gradient descent in the upcoming topics.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Results \n",
    "---\n",
    "- I have created a gui using tkinter to demo perceptron learning rule with single decision boundary\n",
    "- To run the program you clone the repository\n",
    "- run **`Shah_01_01.py`** file which will create the gui\n",
    "- Below is the sceenshot of the gui\n",
